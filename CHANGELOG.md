# Changelog
## [1.12.0] - 2024-12-04
## Added
- **nexus_oss** Introduced variables to control waiting time for nexus to startup.
  `nexus_api_availability_delay: 10`
  `nexus_api_availability_retries: 30`
- **config_api** Added support to normalize all maven type repositories.
  you can now use your `nexus_repos_maven_hosted`, `nexus_repos_maven_proxy` and `nexus_repos_maven_group` definitions with the `config_api` role without reformatting the dictionary.
- **config_api** Added support to normalize all docker type repositories.
  you can now use your `nexus_repos_docker_hosted`, `nexus_repos_docker_proxy` and `nexus_repos_docker_group` definitions with the `config_api` role without reformatting the dictionary.

#### Important note on repository defaults
The `config_api` role uses a different approach to set defaults. If you override the `_nexus_repos_maven_defaults` variable, make sure you apply the same defaults to the `nexus_repos_global_defaults`, `nexus_repos_type_defaults` and `nexus_repos_format_defaults` dictionaries! See role defaults for the full dictionaries.

## Fixed
- **config_api** Use defaults from `_nexus_repos_maven_defaults` for normalizing maven repos.
- **nexus_oss** Fixed attribute `allow_redeploy_latest` for docker repos

## Changed
- **nexus_oss** Renamed `layout_policy` to `deploy_policy` for yum repos

## [1.10.2] - 2024-11-30

### Added

- **Config API - Compatibility for Cleanup Policies defined in nexus_oss**
  Cleanup policies defined for the `nexus_oss` role are now fully compatible with the `config_api` role. A new filter automatically normalizes the cleanup policies API payload to the required format.
  **What this means for you:**
  - No changes are needed to your existing `nexus_repos_cleanup_policies` definitions when transitioning to the `config_api` role.
  - Your current configurations will work seamlessly without requiring manual transformation.

- **Config API - Compatibility for Anonymous Access defined in nexus_oss**
  Anonymous Access settings defined for the `nexus_oss` role are now compatible with the `config_api` role. A new filter normalizes the anonymous access API payload to the correct format.
  **What this means for you:**
  - You can continue using your existing `nexus_anonymous_access` definitions.
  - No manual adjustments are required when migrating to the `config_api` role.

- **Config API - Compatibility for Security Realms defined in nexus_oss**
  Security realms configured in the `nexus_oss` role are now automatically mapped and normalized to be compatible with the `config_api` role.
  **What this means for you:**
  - The standalone realm variables (e.g., `nexus_nuget_api_key_realm`, `nexus_npm_bearer_token_realm`) are now supported directly in `config_api`.
  - You do not need to rewrite these variables; the role will handle the transformation automatically.
  - If you define the `nexus_security_realms` with any realm other than `NexusAuthenticatingRealm`, the realms variables of `nexus_oss` will be ignored.

- **Config API - Compatibility for LDAP Connections defined in nexus_oss**
  The `config_api` role now supports LDAP connections defined in the legacy format used by the `nexus_oss` role. A new filter normalizes these connections to the required API-compatible format.
  **What this means for you:**
  - You can continue using the legacy `ldap_connections` format as defined in the `nexus_oss` role.
  - However, it is **recommended** to adopt the new API-compatible format for future configurations to ensure consistency and compatibility with future updates.

- **Config API - Compatibility for Content Selectors defined in nexus_oss**
  The `config_api` role now supports Content Selectors defined in the legacy format used by the `nexus_oss` role. A new filter normalizes these connections to the required API-compatible format.
  **What this means for you:**
  - You can continue using the legacy `nexus_content_selectors` format as defined in the `nexus_oss` role.

- **Config API - Compatibility for Local Nexus Users defined in nexus_oss**
  The `config_api` role now supports Local Nexus Users defined in the legacy format used by the `nexus_oss` role. A new filter normalizes these connections to the required API-compatible format.
  **What this means for you:**
  - You can continue using the legacy `nexus_local_users` format as defined in the `nexus_oss` role.

### Changed
- **config_api** `nexus_enable_pro` variable has be renamed to `nexus_enable_pro_version` to be compatible with nexus_oss role.
- **config_api** `nexus_routing_rules` variable has be renamed to `nexus_repos_routing_rules` to be compatible with nexus_oss role.
- **config_api** `nexus_users` variable has be renamed to `nexus_local_users` to be compatible with nexus_oss role.

---
### Summary of Actions

1. **Transitioning to `config_api`:** If you're currently using the `nexus_oss` role:
   - You **do not need to rewrite** your existing configurations for cleanup policies, anonymous access, content selectors or security realms.
   - All legacy configurations will be normalized automatically.
2. **LDAP Connections:** While legacy LDAP connection definitions are supported, itâ€™s a good opportunity to transition to the new API-compatible format to future-proof your setup.
3. **Security Realms:** Our recommendation is to configure security realms using the `config_api` role and not using the `nexus_oss` role.
4. **Change routing rules variable:** Change `nexus_routing_rules` to `nexus_repos_routing_rules`
5. **Change nexus Pro variable:** Change `nexus_enable_pro` to `nexus_enable_pro_version`
