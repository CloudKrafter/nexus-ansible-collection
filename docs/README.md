When using this in a 'desired-state' kind of way, renaming repositories is not supported. This has to do with the fact when you rename a repository, it will be considered a new repo and the old one will be deleted since its not in the list of 'desired repos' anymore.

Unfortunatly repos do not have an unique identifier that's returned by the Nexus API, therefore we can not use that to update a new of a repo.
